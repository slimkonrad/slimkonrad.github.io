## CPSC 120 Labs
* Lab 5, Part 1
This is the lab where I began to properly understand user input and how to store/prompt it. On top of that this lab helped me better understand how and why it is better to properly organize your code. Finally, this lab helped me incorporate math into c++ for the first time.
* Lab 7, Part 2
This lab is one of my favorite labs and it really challenged me, making me critically think and apply topics we learned in lecture. This lab contained many if statements, challenging my mind to properly think logically with conditions. On top of this, it also forced me to debug and scan my code properly which ultimately helped me progress with future labs, resulting in less errors while compiling.
* Lab 11, Part 1
This lab was the first lab where we had to properly finish and definite constructors and functions. This was probably the most challenging lab for me, because the readme file for the lab wasn't as informative compared to the past labs. However, as a result of the lectures, and my past experience coding in Java and Python, I was able to finish this lab pretty easily with the help of the TA. I liked this lab as it helped assess where I was in my progress.
